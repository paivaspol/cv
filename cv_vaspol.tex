\section{\small WORK EXPERIENCE}
    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill 10/2018 - 3/2019 \\
    Google Inc. Ann Arbor, MI\\
    Team: Chrome Data Saver \\
    \emph{Project:} Wrap up the projects done with the team over Summer of 2017
    and 2018 by submitting a paper to the NSDI 2020 conference.

    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill 6/2018 - 8/2018 \\
    Google Inc., Seattle, WA\\
    Team: Chrome Data Saver \\
    \emph{Project:} Optimized Chrome Lite Page render performance by
    identifying that fetches of CSS slows down rendering.
    %
    Sped up the rendering of web pages by 50\% by inlining CSS to the HTML,
    which eliminates the penalty of fetching CSS resources over the network.
    %

    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill 9/2017 - 12/2017 \\
    Google Inc., Mountain View, CA\\
    Team: Ads Quality \\
    \emph{Project:} Investigated various prefetching strategies to better
    understand performance implications of prefetching different web page resource.

    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill 5/2017 - 8/2017 \\
    Google Inc., Seattle, WA\\
    Team: Chrome Data Saver \\
    \emph{Project:} Prototyped of a server-side rendering system to improve the
    user experience when browsing the web on slow cellular networks using
    resource-constrained devices; press release:
    \url{https://blog.chromium.org/2019/03/chrome-lite-pages-for-faster-leaner.html}.

    \textbf{Graduate Student Research Assistant} \hfill 5/2015 - Present \\
    Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha.\\
    Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI

    \textbf{Software Developer Engineer in Test Intern} \hfill 6/2013 - 9/2013 \\
    Microsoft. Redmond, WA\\
    Project: Extended Windows Intune test framework to support fuzz testing, developed test modules
    using the extended features, and incorporated the module as part of the weekly test suite.

    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill 6/2012 - 8/2012 \\
    Cobalt. Seattle, WA\\
    Project: Designed and developed an internal monitoring tool that periodically aggregates application server logs for checking system health.


\section{\small RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}
  \textbf{Longitudinal study of the web complexity and web performance}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha \hfill 2019 - 2020}\\
    In this project, we seek to answer the following questions: ``How have
      web pages changed over the years?'', and ``What has been the corresponding
      impact on web performance?''. We conduct a longitudinal study using the
      HTTP Archive dataset to study the relationship between the change in page
      complexity and the change in performance websites between the year 2016
      and 2019. We observe that many of the web pages with more content in 2019
      compared to 2016 do not see a proportionate slowdown in their loads.

  \textbf{Optimizing rendering for Google Lite Pages}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha and Chrome Data Saver Team\hfill
    2017 - 2019}\\
    The Chrome Data Saver proxy optimizes web pages loads by having performant
    proxies substantially simplify web pages. we investigated the rendering
    inefficiencies of the simplified web pages and devise optimizations that
    accelerate the simplified pages, which results in a 50\% improvement in
    rendering.


  \textbf{Vroom} [SIGCOMM'17]\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha \hfill 2015 - 2017}\\
    Mobile page loads are slow because of underutilization of network and
    computational resources; a client can fetch the resources on a page only
    after it discovers them by parsing and executing other resources on the
    page.  I designed and implemented the Vroom framework, which decouples
    discovery of resources from parsing and execution by leveraging recent web
    optimization techniques such as HTTP/2 PUSH and Link preload headers. Vroom
    is able to improve the median page load time by 5 seconds.

	\textbf{Improving latency from clients to cloud services}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha \hfill 05/2015 - 10/2015}\\
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzed internet measurement data to identify degradations of
      latency between clients and web service front-ends.
    \item Designed and implemented an algorithm for dynamically varying
      which front-end a client is redirected to in order to minimize the
      user-perceived latencies.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Numerical input gestures for visually-impaired people}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Richard Ladner \hfill 2011 - 2014}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed special gestures for inputting numbers on smartphones
      by leveraging multi-touch input surface for blind smartphone users. [ASSETS'12]
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Myria, Big Data as a Service}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Magdalena Balazinska \hfill 2012 - 2014}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a database operator in the system. [SIGMOD'14]
	\end{itemize}
