\section{\small INTERESTS}
  My primary research interest is in web performance. Currently, I focus
  on making the web faster while preserving the web security model. I am also interested
  in other aspects of web performance such as metrics for measuring web performance.
  In addition, my research interests also include distributed systems, 
  which I have also done some research on wide-area Internet measurements, 
  and distributed storage systems.

\section{\small RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}
	\textbf{Improving mobile web performance via aids from web servers}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha \hfill 10/2015 - Present}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Understood the fundamental reasons why web pages are slow and use this 
      knowledge to design a system that leverages recent advances of web optimization 
      techniques such as HTTP/2 PUSH and Link preload headers to reduce 
      web page load time.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Improving front-end latency to cloud services}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha \hfill 05/2015 - 10/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzed internet measurement data to see patterns of front-end latency 
      degradation and understood how to implement front-end server redirection for the client.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Numerical input gestures for visually-impaired people}\\
    \textit{Advisor: Prof. Richard Ladner \hfill 2011 - 2014}
